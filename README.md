# t3cm learning extension

## Purpose

This extension was created at the TYPO3 Camp Munich in 2016 and serves
mainly for documentation purposes, but it might be used for Live Coding
Sessions at the t3cm again and will therefor grow.

This code will not be changed outside of the t3cm. Only comments will be
added. You are encouraged to add your own comment, if i forgot something
that was mentioned while the session took place. Or things that MUST be
in there, because they are security relevant.
